# Telecom Support Chatbot

The Telecom Support Chatbot is a locally running, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that answers user queries related to telecom support â€” including call/data/SMS plans, device configuration, troubleshooting, and more. The system utilizes FAISS for vector similarity search and the Phi-3 Mini model running via Ollama for generating intelligent responses.

## Demo

> Ask questions like:
> - "What are the latest call packages for Telenor?"
> - "How to troubleshoot network issues?"
> - "Tell me the data offers for Jazz."

## Features

- Local LLM integration using Ollama with Phi-3 Mini
- FAISS vector store for fast similarity search
- HuggingFace sentence embeddings (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- Streamlit web UI for user interaction
- Supports querying over multiple PDF documents
- Stateless, real-time question answering pipeline

Setup Instructions
Install Ollama and pull Phi-3 Mini


ollama pull phi3:mini
Install Python dependencies


pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit App


streamlit run app.py
Ensure the vectorstore/ folder is already generated using the ingestion step. If not, use a document processing script to convert your PDFs into a FAISS index.

Future Work:

1. Add support for voice-to-text input and TTS output

2. Integrate real-time telecom APIs for dynamic offer retrieval

3. Add memory for multi-turn contextual chat

4. Implement user feedback loop for improving chatbot performance

5. Deploy as a containerized app using Docker for portability
